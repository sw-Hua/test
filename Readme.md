**3.** ***\*Implementation technology\****

1). The user layer

In this project, we will use H5, Vue.js, ElementUI and other technologies when building the front-end page of the system management background.

 

2). The application layer

SpringBoot: Quickly build Spring projects, using the idea of "convention over configuration" to simplify the configuration of Spring projects.

Spring: Centrally manages the various resources (beans) in a project, which are used in all layers of Web development.

SpringMVC: SpringMVC is a module of the Spring framework. SpringMVC and Spring can be seamlessly integrated without the need for an intermediate integration layer.

SpringSession: addresses Session sharing in a clustered environment.

Lombok: Can simplify Java code in the form of simple annotations, improve the development efficiency of developers. For example, Javabeans that often need to be written in development will take time to add the appropriate getter/setter, and perhaps also to write the constructor, equals, etc.

Swagger: Helps developers automatically document and test interfaces.

 

3)The data layer

MySQL: relational database. The core business data of this project will be stored by MySQL.

MybatisPlus: This project persistence layer will use MybatisPlus to simplify the development, the basic single table add, delete, change and check directly call the method provided by the frame.

Redis: an in-memory database stored in key-value format with high access speed. It is often used as a cache (to reduce database access pressure and provide access efficiency) and will be used in future performance optimization.

 

4) Tools

Git: A version control tool that is used to manage code in a project during team work.

Maven: Project building tool.

Junit: unit test tool. After functions are implemented, developers need to use junit to unit test functions.
